# Outdoor-Air-Filter
Thermal solar-powered outdoor air purifier for cleaning city air pollution. 

The goal:Research and develop an open-source, cost-effective outdoor air purifier to be used in cities (or anywhere) to to remove PM2.5 air pollution and improve overall air quality.

The original concept (untested as of yet): a black tube that acts as a solar oven, and convection drives air through a filter. These tubes might be mounted over sidewalks and roadways, attached to telephone or light poles, buildings, or trees.

Possible additional features: utilizing rainfall to clean filter, fan to capture energy at top of tube might be used to create a charge to attract particles

Potential issues: protecting the filter fixture from nesting birds, the sediment runoff might be toxic and cause local water/river pollution, runoff might also be undesirable if it is dripping sludge onto pedestrians who are walking beneath the filters.
